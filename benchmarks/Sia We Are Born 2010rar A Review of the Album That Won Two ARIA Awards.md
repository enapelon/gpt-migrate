# Review: Sia's We Are Born (2010) - A Pop Masterpiece
 
Sia Furler, better known as Sia, is an Australian singer-songwriter who has been making waves in the music industry since the late 1990s. She is known for her distinctive voice, quirky style, and collaborations with artists such as David Guetta, Rihanna, and Maddie Ziegler. But before she became a global pop star, she released a series of albums that showcased her versatility and talent as a solo artist.
 
One of these albums is We Are Born, which was released in 2010. It is Sia's fifth studio album and her most upbeat and colorful one to date. It features influences from 1980s pop, rock, funk, and soul, as well as guest appearances from Nick Valensi of The Strokes and Inara George of The Bird and the Bee. The album received critical acclaim and won two ARIA Music Awards for Best Pop Release and Best Independent Release.

The album then slows down with the beautiful ballad "Stop Trying", which is a message of acceptance and self-love. Sia sings, "We like you / This is a game already won / Stop trying". The song is followed by another ballad, "You've Changed", which is about moving on from a toxic relationship. It showcases Sia's powerful vocals and emotional delivery.
 
The album then picks up the pace again with the upbeat and infectious "Be Good to Me", which features Nick Valensi on guitar. It is a song about asking for loyalty and honesty from a partner. The next track, "Bring Night", is a disco-inspired tune that celebrates the joy of nightlife. It is one of the most danceable songs on the album and has a catchy chorus that goes, "Bring night / Bring night / And I'll come alive".
 
The album then takes a darker turn with the haunting and atmospheric "Hurting Me Now", which is about feeling betrayed and hurt by someone you trusted. It is followed by another dark song, "Never Gonna Leave Me", which is about being obsessed with someone who doesn't love you back. It has a creepy vibe and a distorted vocal effect that adds to the tension.
 
The album then lightens up again with the uplifting and optimistic "Cloud", which is about finding happiness in simple things. It is followed by another positive song, "I'm in Here", which is about reaching out for help when you're feeling low. It is one of the most emotional songs on the album and has a piano-driven melody that contrasts with Sia's raw vocals.
 
The album then closes with two covers: "The Co-Dependent", which is a song by Inara George that Sia reworked into a rockabilly style, and "Oh Father", which is a song by Madonna that Sia made into a stripped-down acoustic version. Both songs showcase Sia's ability to reinterpret songs from different genres and make them her own.
 
We Are Born is a pop masterpiece that showcases Sia's versatility, creativity, and personality as an artist. It is an album that explores different themes and emotions through catchy melodies, clever lyrics, and stunning vocals. It is an album that will make you dance, cry, laugh, and sing along.
